#The asset controller is responsible for controlling all the logic behind the assetsâ€“our file class.
#The controller allows one to upload, download, view, and delete their files, as well as sharing/unsharing them.
#Much of the methods called here can be found in the AssetsHelper and the SessionsHelper modules.

  #NOTE: in the methods related to sharing, you will see a lot of string manipulation (primarily .split() and .join(). .split() converts a string to an array, and .join() an array to a string).
  #Sharing works by creating an array that is an assets attribute, listing users that may view it, while created an array on the recipients side, that is a user attribute, listing assets that 
  #the user is a recipient of. Unfortuantely, SQlite3 does not support arrays as a database column type. As a workaround, the "arrays" are converted into strings, and are converted back into 
  #arrays when their data is needed.
