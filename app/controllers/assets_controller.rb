#The asset controller is responsible for controlling all the logic behind the assetsâ€“our file class.
#The controller allows one to upload, download, view, and delete their files, as well as sharing/unsharing them.
#Much of the methods called here can be found in the AssetsHelper and the SessionsHelper modules.
