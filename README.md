CloudShare is a file storage and file sharing website. It was made for our school's computer science class.

This was our first rails project. We used Michael Hartl https://www.railstutorial.org as our preliminary tutorial. Check 
him out!

To access our app, go to: https://cloudshare-project.herokuapp.com

Note that since the app is currently not in use, files will be deleted every day. However, they will still show up in file indexâ€“but if you try to access(download) it, rails will through an error. To fix this, simply delete the file.
